                    <p class="preview-text">Machine Learning has evolved from a vague textbook expression to sophisticated algorithms, predominant in today's world without us even realising. It has become quite the trend in the 21st century and is certainly not tapering off
                        any time soon.
                        <br>Come join us as we explore “Deeper insights into Machine Learning” with Mr. Nikhil John.
                        <br>Mr. Nikhil John is a student of VIT Chennai, with many achievements under his belt. He is an active competitive coder and loves participating in Hackathons in line with Machine Learning, and was also a national finalist at
                        two of those. He holds AIR 1 in the National Engineering Olympiad and has previously interned in various industries like PayPal, Discover Dollar, Okulo Aerospace, MIDAS labs in Delhi, and many more involving Machine Learning and
                        deep neural networks.

                        Have you ever wondered if you could brew the painting?
                        <br> Yes, we are talking about painting with coffee!!
                        <br> Coffee painting is a soothing, unique and delightful art to express our creativity on the canvas. While the sepia tones in the art gives it a unique monochromatic appeal, using the right combinations allows you to experiment
                        with different hues of the monochrome.
                        <br> This event is intended for the creative participants to explore paintings having sepia look. Though this work of art will have limited resources like brush, coffee and paper but the painter’s oeuvre is outstanding. Participants
                        will be able to use coffee as a resourceful medium to be able to create texture, shadows and gradients. It is a way of expression that lets people enjoy art, not only the sight but also smell.
