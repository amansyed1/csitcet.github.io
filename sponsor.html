                        in America but also in Australia, UK, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Ireland and the rest of Europe. It is one of the first institutions in India to start professional coaching for the GRE / GMAT / SAT / TOEFL / IELTS / PTE and
                        has since helped thousands of students to do well in these highly competitive examinations. In the year 2000, IMFS helped the first Indian student to get the “Full Score” in GRE. This feat was repeated in subsequent years and IMFS
                        has helped 8 students secure the “Full Score” in the GRE, a feat unmatched by most other classes in the world.
